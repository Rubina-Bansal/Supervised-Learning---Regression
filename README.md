ML algorithm to predict sales and demand for Walmart (One of the leading retail stores in the US)


### Description:
One of the leading retail stores in the US, Walmart, wants to predict the sales and demand accurately. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. The sales data is available for 45 stores of Walmart. The business is facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and runs out of stock some times, due to the inappropriate machine learning algorithm. An ideal ML algorithm will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like economic conditions including CPI, Unemployment Index, etc.

##### Data

historical data that covers sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01, in the file Walmart_Store_sales.


##### Objective:
* Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
* Build Regression models to predict the sales.
